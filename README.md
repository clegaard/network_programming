# Network Programming

This software contains a simple client and server program written by using C/C++ socket programming. The aim is to provide a functional demonstartion of the socket API function calls 'socket()', ''bind'', '''connect()''', '''listen()''', '''accept''', '''send()''' and '''recv()'''.


For class room demonstration it is posible to use 'screen' to split the screens vertically and run the server and the client in different windows.

Screen is started as: sudo screen

For instance use (CTRL-a |) to split the screen vertically, or use CTRL-a S to split the pane horizontally.
Use CTRL-a TAB to toogle between screens.

Press CTRL-a TAB until youâ€™re in the new, blank pane, then press CTRL-a c to create a new window with a command prompt in this pane.

CTRL-a d till detach a screen from the TTY and put it in the background.
CTRL-a X will close the pane that has focus.
